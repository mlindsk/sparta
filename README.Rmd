## About

The `sparta` package implements new methods (multiplication, marginalization etc.) for dealing with conditional probability tables (CPTs) and are especially useful when the CPTs are sparse.

## Installation

 - Current stable release from CRAN: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("sparta")
```

 - Current development version: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("mlindsk/sparta")
```

## See Also
The `jti`, https://github.com/mlindsk/jti, package (on CRAN) implements belief propagation via the Junction Tree Algorithm which relies heavily on `sparta` tables. See also  https://github.com/mlindsk/pednoa for a usecase of `jti` where "ordinary/dense" table operations will fail.
