## About

The `sparta` package implements new methods (multiplication,
marginalization etc.) for dealing with conditional probability tables
(CPTs) and are especially useful when the CPTs are sparse.

## Installation

  - Current stable release from CRAN:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
install.packages("sparta")
```

  - Current development version:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
devtools::install_github("mlindsk/sparta", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

## See Also

The `jti` package implements belief propagation via the Junction Tree
Algorithm which relies heavily on `sparta` tables for extremely fast
operations.
