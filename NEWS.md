# sparta v0.7.3 (2021-04-22)

 * Bug fixed when argument =drop= is =TRUE= in =slice= for tables that should reduce to one row.

# sparta v0.7.2 (2021-04-03)
 * The new print method turned out to cause problems in the long run. Printing a sparse table now prints columns as rows again with the corresponding value attached to the right.
 * marginalizing is much more memory efficient now. Especially for massive tables.

# sparta v0.7.1.0 (2021-03-01)

 * Multiplication of unity tables was not correct due to the new rank argument. The fix was to multiply the rank of the tables.
 * Print method changed to print cells as columns which is also how the sparse tables are represented under the hood.
 * New functions (see documentation):
   + =sparsity=: determines the ratio of non-zero cells and the size of the statespace.
   + =as_df=: convert a sparse table to a =data.frame=. Either with or without zero cells
   + =get_values=: The same as the existing =vals=

# sparta v0.7.0 (2020-12-16)

 * unity tables now have a rank attribute which is just the
 unique value that all cells have. Because of this, a unity
 table can now be multiplied with a scalar. And regular 
 sparta tables can be multiplied with unities of different rank.
 As a consequence, unities can now be marginalized also.
 
 * New function `equiv` to test if two sparta objects are identical
 
 * Fixed a bug when assigning dimnames to the result of multiplication

# sparta v0.6.1 (2020-11-24)

 * marginalization is now faster due to some refactoring

# sparta v0.6.0 (2020-11-09)

 * Prevent print from printing dimension names
 * A bug, due to wrong sorting, that manifested in both `marg`, `slice`, `mult` and `div` has been fixed. These functions were prone to errors when the number of variables exceed `10`.
 * It is now possible to multiply and divide sparta tables with a scalar where the scalar can be either of the two inputs. Prior to v0.6.0 the scalar had to be the second argument.

# sparta v0.5.0 (2020-10-08)

 * First release
